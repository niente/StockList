# StockList
This program reads a text file of stocks and quotes to create a circularly  doubly-linked list of stacks (in alphabetical order). The list is printed to screen, forwards and backwards. The user can search for two stocks in the list, and print the sub-list between them. The user can search for a stock and input the number of quotes to be read from its stack.
